# Mechanical 7-Segment Display Project

This repository contains the code and design files for a mechanical 7-segment display controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller and interfaced via MQTT.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a unique mechanical 7-segment display that can be controlled remotely using MQTT. The display utilizes the classic 7-segment layout but with a mechanical twist, providing a retro and tactile feel to digital displays.

## Features

- Mechanical 7-segment display design.
- ESP32 firmware for controlling the display.
- MQTT integration for remote control.
- Inspired by designs found on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com).

## Inspiration and Attribution

This project drew inspiration from various designs found on Thingiverse. Specific designs and contributors include:

## Getting Started

### Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 microcontroller board.
- Mechanical 7-segment display components.
- MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto).

### Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO for ESP32 firmware development.
- MQTT client software (e.g., MQTT Explorer) for testing and debugging.

### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the ESP32 firmware in the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
3. Upload the firmware to your ESP32 board.
4. Assemble the mechanical 7-segment display according to the provided designs.
5. Connect the ESP32 to your MQTT broker.
6. Test the functionality by sending MQTT messages to control the display.
